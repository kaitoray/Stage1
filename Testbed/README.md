## Contents

Each folder represents one Virtual machine which contains various source codes for different funtionalities. These includes:

* Primary plant: the physical process
* Trsf1 OverCur Prot: the overcurrent protection IED for transformer1
* Trsf2 OverCur Prot: the overcurrent protection IED for transformer2
* FDR OverCur Prot: the overcurrent protection IED for feeders
* CB_FailProt: the breaker failure protection IED for feeders
* Switch: Network switch in the process bus

## Also

* Port summary.xlsx: indicates all the UDP port number for communication between Simulink and OpenPLC
* CB Trip logics.xlsx: define the trip logics when a short-circuit fault happens.

## Network topology
